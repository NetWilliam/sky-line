    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="First-Inaugural-Address-Excerpts"><a href="#First-Inaugural-Address-Excerpts" class="headerlink" title="First Inaugural Address (Excerpts)"></a>First Inaugural Address (Excerpts)</h2><p>We observe today not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom, symbolizing an end, as well as a beginning; signifying renewal, as well as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than in mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.</p>
<p>Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, “rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation”, a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.</p>
<p>Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and south, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?</p>
<p>In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its  hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility. I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it. And the glow from that fire can truly light the world.</p>
<p>And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.</p>
<p>My fellow citizens of the world, ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.</p>
<p>Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth, God’s work must truly be our own.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Ambition"><a href="#Ambition" class="headerlink" title="Ambition"></a>Ambition</h2><p>It is not difficult to imagine a world short of ambition. It would probably be a kinder world: without demands, without abrasions, without disappointments. People would have time for reflection. Such work as they did would not be for themselves but for the collectivity. Competition would never enter in. Conflict would be eliminated, tension become a thing of the past. The stress of creation would be at an end. Art would no longer be troubling, but purely celebratory in its functions. Longevity would be increased, for fewer people would die of heart attack or stroke caused by tumultuous endeavor. Anxiety would be extinct. Time would stretch on and on, with ambition long departed from the human heart.</p>
<p>Ah, how unrelievedly boring life would be!</p>
<p>There is a strong view that holds that success is a myth, and ambition therefore a sham. Does this mean that success does not really exist? That achievement is at bottom empty? That the efforts of men and women are of no significance alongside the force of movements and events? Now not all success, obviously, is worth esteeming, nor all ambition worth cultivating. Which are and which are not is something one soon enough learns on one’s own. But event the most cynical secretly admit that success exists; that achievement counts for a great deal; and that the true myth is that the actions of men and women are useless. To believe otherwise is to take on a point of view that is likely to be deranging. It is, in its implications. to remove all motives for competence, interest in attainment, and regard for posterity.</p>
<p>We do not choose to be born. We do not choose our parents. We do not choose our historical epoch, the country of our birth, or the immediate circumstances of our upbringing. We do not, most of us, choose to die; nor do we choose the time or conditions of our death. But within all this realm of choicelessness, we do choose how we shall live: courageously or in cowardice, honorably or dishonorably, with purpose or in drift. We decide what is important and what is trivial in life. We decide that what makes us significant is either what we do or what we refuse to do. But no matter how indifferent the universe may be to our choices and decisions, these choices and decisions are ours to make. We decide. We choose. And as we decide and choose, so are our lives formed. In the end, forming our own destiny is what ambition is about.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="If-I-Rest-I-Rust"><a href="#If-I-Rest-I-Rust" class="headerlink" title="If I Rest, I Rust"></a>If I Rest, I Rust</h2><p>The significant inscription found on an old key - “If I rest, I rust” - would be an excellent motto for those who are afflicted with the slightest bit of idleness. Even the most industrious person might adopt it with advantage to serve as a reminder that, if one allows his faculties to rest, like the iron in the unused key, they will soon show signs of rust and, ultimately, cannot do the work required of them.</p>
<p>Those who would attain the heights reached and kept by great men must keep their faculties polished by constant use, so that they may unlock the doors of knowledge, the gates that guard the entrances to the professions, to science, art, literature, agriculture - every department of human endeavor.</p>
<p>Industry keeps bright the key that opens the treasury of achievement. If Hugh Miller, after toiling all day in q quarry, had devoted his evenings to rest and recreation, he would never have become a famous geologist. The celebrated mathematician, Edmund Stone, would never have published a mathematical dictionary, never have found the key to science of mathematics, if he had given his spare moments to idleness. Had the little Scotch lad, Ferguson, allowed the busy brain to go to sleep while he tended sheep on the hillside, instead of calculating the position of the stars by a string of beads, he would never have become a famous astronomer.</p>
<p>Labor vanquishes all - not inconstant, spasmodic, or ill-directed labor; but faithful, unremitting, daily effort toward a well-directed purpose. Just as truly as eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, so is eternal industry the price of noble and enduring success.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Companionship-of-Books-Excerpts"><a href="#Companionship-of-Books-Excerpts" class="headerlink" title="Companionship of Books (Excerpts)"></a>Companionship of Books (Excerpts)</h2><p>A man may usually be known by the books he reads as well as by the company he keeps; for there is a companionship of books as well as of men; and one should always live in the best company, whether it be of books or of men.</p>
<p>A good book may be among the best of friends. It is the same today that it always was, and it will never change. It is the most patient and cheerful of companions. It does not turn its back upon us  in times of adversity or distress. It always receives us with the same kindness; amusing and instructing us in youth, and comforting and consoling us in age.</p>
<p>Men often discover their affinity to each other by the mutual love they have for a book just as two persons sometimes discover a friend by the admiration which both entertain for a third. There is an old proverb, “Love me, love my dog.” But there is more wisdom in this: “Love me, love my book.” The book is a truer and higher bond of union. Men can think, fell, and sympathize with each other through their favorite author. They live in him together, and he in them.</p>
<p>A good book is often the best urn of a life enshrining the best that life could think out; for the world of a man’s life is, for the most part, but the world of his thoughts. Thus the best books are treasuries of good words, the golden thoughts, which, remembered and cherished, become our constant companions and comforters.</p>
<p>Books possess an essence of immortality. They are by far the most lasting products of human effort. Temples and statues decay, but books survive. Time is of no account with great thoughts, which are as fresh today as when they first passed through their author’s minds, ages ago. What was then said and thought still speaks to us as vividly as ever from the printed page. The only effect of time has been to sift out the bad products; for nothing in literature can long survive but what is really good.</p>
<p>Books introduce us into the best society; they bring us into the presence of the greatest minds that have ever lived. We hear what they said and did; we see them as if they were really alive; we sympathize with them, enjoy with them, grieve with them; their experience becomes ours, and we feel as if we were in a measure actors with them in the scenes which they describe.</p>
<p>The great and good do not die, even in this world. Embalmed in books, their spirits walk abroad. The book is a living voice. It is an intellect to which one still listens.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Three-Days-to-See-Excerpts"><a href="#Three-Days-to-See-Excerpts" class="headerlink" title="Three Days to See (Excerpts)"></a>Three Days to See (Excerpts)</h2><p>All of us have read thrilling stories in which the hero had only a limited and specified time to live. Sometimes it was as long as a year; sometimes as short as twenty-four hours. But always we were interested in discovering just how the doomed man chose to spend his last days or his last hours. I speak, of course, of free men who have a choice, not condemned criminals whose sphere of activities is strictly delimited.</p>
<p>Such stories set us thinking, wondering what we should do under similar circumstances. What events, what experiences, what associations should we crowd into those last hours as mortal beings? What happiness should we find in reviewing the past, what regrets?</p>
<p>Sometimes I have thought it would be an excellent rule to live each day as if we should die tomorrow. Such an attitude would emphasize sharply the values of life. We should live each day with gentleness, vigor, and a keenness of appreciation which are often lost when time streches before us in the constant panorama of more days and months and years to come. There are those, of course, who would adopt the Epicurean motto of “Eat, drink, and be merry.” But most people would be chastened by the certainty of impending death.</p>
<p>In stories the doomed hero is usually saved at the last minute by some stroke of fortune, but almost always his sense of values is changed. He becomes more appreciative of the meaning of life and its permanent spiritual values. It has often been noted that those who live, or have lived, in the shadow of death bring a mellow sweetness to everything they do.</p>
<p>Most of us, however, take life for granted. We know that one day we must die, but usually we picture that day as far in future. When we are in buoyant health, death is all but unimaginable. We seldom think of it. The days stretch out in an endless vista. So we go about our petty tasks, hardly aware of our listless attitude toward life.</p>
<p>The same lethargy, I am afraid, characterizes the use of all our faculties and senses. Only the deaf appreciate hearing, only the blind realize the manifold blessings that lie in sight. Particularly does this observation apply to those who have lost sight and hearing in adult life. But those who have never suffered impairment of sight or hearing seldom make the fullest use of these blessed faculties. Their eyes and ears take in all sights and sounds hazily, without concentration and with little appreciation. It is the same old story of not being grateful for what we have until we lose it, of not being conscious of health until we are ill.</p>
<p>I have often thought it would be a blessing if each human being were stricken blind and deaf for a few days at some time during his early adult life. Darkness would make him more appreciative of sight; silence would teach him the joys of sound.</p>

In the days of Napoleon, of which I was speaking just now, the same wind which would have carried his transports across the Channel might have driven away the blockading fleet. There was always the chance, and it is that chance which has excited and befooled the imaginations of many Continental tyrants. Many are the tales that are told. We are assured that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality of malice, the ingenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind of novel stratagem and every kind of brutal and treacherous manœuvre. I think that no idea is so outlandish that it should not be considered and viewed with a searching, but at the same time, I hope, with a steady eye. We must never forget the solid assurances of sea power and those which belong to air power if it can be locally exercised.</p>
<p>I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once more able to defend our island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty’s Government – every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength.</p>
<p>Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="J-K-Rowling’s-Speech-At-Commencement-of-Harvard-University-Excerpts"><a href="#J-K-Rowling’s-Speech-At-Commencement-of-Harvard-University-Excerpts" class="headerlink" title="J.K. Rowling’s Speech At Commencement of Harvard University (Excerpts)"></a>J.K. Rowling’s Speech At Commencement of Harvard University (Excerpts)</h2><p>…<br>I would like to make it clear, in parenthesis, that I do not blame my parents for their point of view. There is an expiry date on blaming your parents for steering you in the wrong direction; the moment you are old enough to take the wheel, responsibility lies with you. What is more, I cannot criticise my parents for hoping that I would never experience poverty. They had been poor themselves, and I have since been poor, and I quite agree with them that it is not an ennobling experience. Poverty entails fear, and stress, and sometimes depression; it means a thousand petty humiliations and hardships. Climbing out of poverty by your own efforts, that is indeed something on which to pride yourself, but poverty itself is romanticised only by fools.</p>
<p>What I feared most for myself at your age was not poverty, but failure.</p>
<p>t your age, in spite of a distinct lack of motivation at university, where I had spent far too long in the coffee bar writing stories, and far too little time at lectures, I had a knack for passing examinations, and that, for years, had been the measure of success in my life and that of my peers.</p>
<p>I am not dull enough to suppose that because you are young, gifted and well-educated, you have never known hardship or heartbreak. Talent and intelligence never yet inoculated anyone against the caprice of the Fates, and I do not for a moment suppose that everyone here has enjoyed an existence of unruffled privilege and contentment.</p>
<p>However, the fact that you are graduating from Harvard suggests that you are not very well-acquainted with failure. You might be driven by a fear of failure quite as much as a desire for success. Indeed, your conception of failure might not be too far from the average person’s idea of success, so high have you already flown.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we all have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure, but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria if you let it. So I think it fair to say that by any conventional measure, a mere seven years after my graduation day, I had failed on an epic scale. An exceptionally short-lived marriage had imploded, and I was jobless, a lone parent, and as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless. The fears that my parents had had for me, and that I had had for myself, had both come to pass, and by every usual standard, I was the biggest failure I knew.</p>
<p>Now, I am not going to stand here and tell you that failure is fun. That period of my life was a dark one, and I had no idea that there was going to be what the press has since represented as a kind of fairy tale resolution. I had no idea then how far the tunnel extended, and for a long time, any light at the end of it was a hope rather than a reality.</p>
<p>So why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realised, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.</p>
<p>You might never fail on the scale I did, but some failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all – in which case, you fail by default.</p>
<p>Failure gave me an inner security that I had never attained by passing examinations. Failure taught me things about myself that I could have learned no other way. I discovered that I had a strong will, and more discipline than I had suspected; I also found out that I had friends whose value was truly above the price of rubies.</p>
<p>The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive. You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships, until both have been tested by adversity. Such knowledge is a true gift, for all that it is painfully won, and it has been worth more than any qualification I ever earned.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Gettysburg-Address"><a href="#Gettysburg-Address" class="headerlink" title="Gettysburg Address"></a>Gettysburg Address</h2><p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</p>
<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>
<p>But, in a large sense, we can not dedicate - we can not consecrate - we can not hallow - this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Youth"><a href="#Youth" class="headerlink" title="Youth"></a>Youth</h2><p>Youth is not time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter the rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.</p>
<p>Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease. This often exists in a man of 60 more than a boy of 20. Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals.</p>
<p>Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust.</p>
<p>Whether 60 or 16, there is in every human being’s heart the lure of wonder, the unfailing childlike appetite for what’s next and the joy of the game of living. In the center of your heart and my heart there is a wireless station: so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer, courage and power from men and from the Infinite, so long are you young.</p>
<p>When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism and ice of pessimism, then you are grown old, even at 20; but as long as your aerials are up, to catch waves of optimism, there is hope you may die young at 80.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="What-I-Have-Lived-For"><a href="#What-I-Have-Lived-For" class="headerlink" title="What I Have Lived For"></a>What I Have Lived For</h2><p>Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a deep ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.</p>
<p>I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of my life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness - that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it, finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what - at last - I have found.</p>
<p>With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved.</p>
<p>Love and Knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a hated burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.</p>
<p>This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="高考"><a href="#高考" class="headerlink" title="高考"></a>高考</h2><h3 id="我的经历"><a href="#我的经历" class="headerlink" title="我的经历"></a>我的经历</h3><p>春节这些天我在北京, 一直在看书一直在思考. 思考我一直以来对事情的理解和处理方法的不当的地方.<br>有些做得不对的地方从高中就开始了. 高考前的几次摸底考试在班上平时成绩7,8名, 可是高考放榜后发现排名大概18名, 离一本线差5分, 在我之前还有个一本线差1分的. 当时觉得不是特别好.<br>吴书豪也说过班上的同学考得比较糟. 他高考前三个月开始发力, 我不知道他是怎么发现班上同学考的比较糟糕的. 可对我来说, 都一样: 高考终于结束了.</p>
<p>最让我反感的就是高考的命题作文, 这种作文要写好, 最好写个议论性质的散文, 也就所谓的什么都没说, 但是私藏了一大堆私货的文章.<br>在这个过程中, 司马迁受了无数次宫刑. 我们作为祖国的花朵, 未来的刀笔吏, 无数次的阉割了太史公, 我很心痛.</p>
<p>散文行到实在无话可说之处, 可让太史公出来受刑:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>无法入睡的夜晚, 死囚的监狱分外寂静<br>司马迁在狱中看到皇帝的诏书, 他的手在止不住的颤抖, 士可杀不可辱! 司马迁心中一阵怒火, 死亡并没有让他恐惧, 而是静下心来思考人生的意义<br>人生自古谁无死, 留取丹心照汗青, 文天祥的话穿越时空回响在他的耳边, 死并不可怕, 可怕的是人生没有意义, 不能实现价值, 不能开宗立派传播学说<br>想起还没有修完的史记, 司马迁脸上露出了一副欣慰的表情, 是的, 一定要把史记写完, 实现”<em>与你为邻</em>(<em>绿色生活</em>, <em>找回童年</em>, <em>仰望星空, 脚踏实地</em>等作文题主题)<br>司马迁平静地对狱卒说, 我选择宫刑<br>寂静的夜晚, 只有孤独的月光投在他的脸上, “”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>司马迁已然欣然受刑之后仍然无话可说, 那就使用名人名言. 名人一般用苏格拉底, 亚里士多德, 文化好一点的可以用尼采, 司汤达, 陀思妥耶夫斯基, 剑走偏锋可以召唤毛姆, 安兰德, 维特根斯坦<br>当这些人的名人名言都用完了, 而你的散文还没有凑到字数, 那就只用用最后一招了: 请先贤<br>先贤以美国学者/教授或者古希腊哲/德国哲学家为甚.</p>
<p>比如美国著名学者肖玉秀.<br>开玩笑的</p>
<p>直接写我们英语老师肖玉秀的名讳我们的语文老师王薇老师要生气的<br>于是我们要变通, 比如肖对应sculpture, 玉对应jade, 秀对应show, 那么这位美国著名学者, 哈佛大学社会心理学博士的名字就叫做斯卡普彻尔 点 杰德, 于是show就可以留给下一个古希腊的哲学家用, 或者作为斯卡普彻尔教授的中间名凑字数.<br>当然这个时候要展现出灵活性, 这样的名人肯定不会因为说了一句”吃饭是人类的本性”而闻名的, 我们需要一些形而上的名言来作为前段的总结和开启后面的叨逼, 所以类似于”人类在宇宙中的位置” “人生的意义” “瞬间与永恒” “家庭, 爱与美”这样形而上的名言是最不错的</p>
<p>当然, 多年以后, 我想起来, 咪蒙老师写命题作文比我们顺手多了, 至少她只需要请我一朋友, 我一同学, 我邻居的大舅就行了, 用不着每次都费尽心力请古希腊哲学家肯德罗夫菠菠斯基<br>不过做迷蒙老师的朋友和同学或者她邻居家的二舅就很累了, 动不动老公就直男癌, 就家暴, 就出轨, 为了你们的幸福着想, 朋友们, 谨慎跟咪蒙老师这样的人打交道.</p>
<p>我不知道高考前三个月开始发力的吴书豪是怎么发现大家考得不好的<br>我永不放弃武力作为解决与其他男性的矛盾的最终途径的权利<br>, 当然, 看上去我们的教授是个标准的中年白人男性, 如果要突出美国的多元文化和种族的diversity, 只需要将jade翻译成 耶德</p>
<h3 id="高考的本质"><a href="#高考的本质" class="headerlink" title="高考的本质"></a>高考的本质</h3><p>当时不懂事, 只觉得自己是被时代的洪流裹挟着向前, 结束这场高考就行了, 现在想想简直是太稚嫩了.<br>一方面, 差一点上一本线(当年一本上线率4.60%), 在一帮获得985 211录取通知的同学中间显得很掉价; 另一方面其他的平时比我更用功, 更努力的同学考出来却只能准备复读, 我觉得有种黑色幽默的荒诞.<br>正如当时隐约看过的理论来说, 高考并不是让大家都上大学, 而是用来决定谁不能上大学, 以及上大学的人当中谁上更好的大学. 当时觉得高考是个很糟糕的制度, 现在看来并非如此.<br>考学和文官制度是正经的宝贵的东方文化遗产, 是一套注重机会平等社会层级流通方式. 在这个过程中, 衡量的手段客观而且容易量化, 因此是一个简单易行的社会分化器, 无数人的人生轨迹就被这个考试改变了.</p>
<p>高考十分注重方法论和总结, 能在这两点上做好的人, 做其他方面也不会差. 有个说法说就算现在高考改成打dota, 也还是那些原本上重点大学的人继续上重点大学. 这话不无道理.</p>
<h3 id="方法论"><a href="#方法论" class="headerlink" title="方法论"></a>方法论</h3><p>高考能够做好的人, 其他的东西也不会差<br>方法论的尝试提炼和升级是人的核心竞争力</p>
<h2 id="大学"><a href="#大学" class="headerlink" title="大学"></a>大学</h2><h3 id="本科上成了专科"><a href="#本科上成了专科" class="headerlink" title="本科上成了专科"></a>本科上成了专科</h3><p>然而即使是在大学里面, 我做得也并不好.<br>本科学习的本质大部分实际上是为了继续下一步深入的学习和研究做准备和铺垫, 而并非培养技术工人. 读本科正确的做法应该是学而优则学, 而我却花了太多的时间在一些 “七天学会PHP 21天学会C++” 以及焦虑上.<br>在本科的学习过程中, 我尝试去做了一些事情, 有成功也有失败, 但是总体来说还是做得很不到位的, 总结做得并不好. 在学习方法和自我管理方面基本没有主动去学习, 这也是造成后来我的第一份工作非常吃力的原因之一.</p>
<h3 id="本科的本质"><a href="#本科的本质" class="headerlink" title="本科的本质"></a>本科的本质</h3><p>为继续深入学习研究做准备和铺垫, 并非培养技术工人. 学而优则学<br>尝试去做事情, 有成功有失败, 但是总结做得不到位<br>学会学习方法和自我管理, 基本没做</p>
