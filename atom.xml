    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>J.K. Rowling’s Speech At Commencement of Harvard University (excerpt)</p>
<p>…<br>I would like to make it clear, in parenthesis, that I do not blame my parents for their point of view. There is an expiry date on blaming your parents for steering you in the wrong direction; the moment you are old enough to take the wheel, responsibility lies with you. What is more, I cannot criticise my parents for hoping that I would never experience poverty. They had been poor themselves, and I have since been poor, and I quite agree with them that it is not an ennobling experience. Poverty entails fear, and stress, and sometimes depression; it means a thousand petty humiliations and hardships. Climbing out of poverty by your own efforts, that is indeed something on which to pride yourself, but poverty itself is romanticised only by fools.</p>
<p>What I feared most for myself at your age was not poverty, but failure.</p>
<p>t your age, in spite of a distinct lack of motivation at university, where I had spent far too long in the coffee bar writing stories, and far too little time at lectures, I had a knack for passing examinations, and that, for years, had been the measure of success in my life and that of my peers.</p>
<p>I am not dull enough to suppose that because you are young, gifted and well-educated, you have never known hardship or heartbreak. Talent and intelligence never yet inoculated anyone against the caprice of the Fates, and I do not for a moment suppose that everyone here has enjoyed an existence of unruffled privilege and contentment.</p>
<p>However, the fact that you are graduating from Harvard suggests that you are not very well-acquainted with failure. You might be driven by a fear of failure quite as much as a desire for success. Indeed, your conception of failure might not be too far from the average person’s idea of success, so high have you already flown.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we all have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure, but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria if you let it. So I think it fair to say that by any conventional measure, a mere seven years after my graduation day, I had failed on an epic scale. An exceptionally short-lived marriage had imploded, and I was jobless, a lone parent, and as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless. The fears that my parents had had for me, and that I had had for myself, had both come to pass, and by every usual standard, I was the biggest failure I knew.</p>
<p>Now, I am not going to stand here and tell you that failure is fun. That period of my life was a dark one, and I had no idea that there was going to be what the press has since represented as a kind of fairy tale resolution. I had no idea then how far the tunnel extended, and for a long time, any light at the end of it was a hope rather than a reality.</p>
<p>So why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realised, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.</p>
<p>You might never fail on the scale I did, but some failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all – in which case, you fail by default.</p>
<p>Failure gave me an inner security that I had never attained by passing examinations. Failure taught me things about myself that I could have learned no other way. I discovered that I had a strong will, and more discipline than I had suspected; I also found out that I had friends whose value was truly above the price of rubies.</p>
<p>The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive. You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships, until both have been tested by adversity. Such knowledge is a true gift, for all that it is painfully won, and it has been worth more than any qualification I ever earned.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Gettysburg-Address"><a href="#Gettysburg-Address" class="headerlink" title="Gettysburg Address"></a>Gettysburg Address</h2><p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</p>
<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>
<p>But, in a large sense, we can not dedicate - we can not consecrate - we can not hallow - this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus for so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Youth"><a href="#Youth" class="headerlink" title="Youth"></a>Youth</h2><p>Youth is not time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter the rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.</p>
<p>Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease. This often exists in a man of 60 more than a boy of 20. Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals.</p>
<p>Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust.</p>
<p>Whether 60 or 16, there is in every human being’s heart the lure of wonder, the unfailing childlike appetite for what’s next and the joy of the game of living. In the center of your heart and my heart there is a wireless station: so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer, courage and power from men and from the Infinite, so long are you young.</p>
<p>When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism and ice of pessimism, then you are grown old, even at 20; but as long as your aerials are up, to catch waves of optimism, there is hope you may die young at 80.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="What-I-Have-Lived-For"><a href="#What-I-Have-Lived-For" class="headerlink" title="What I Have Lived For"></a>What I Have Lived For</h2><p>Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a deep ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.</p>
<p>I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of my life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness - that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it, finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what - at last - I have found.</p>
<p>With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved.</p>
<p>Love and Knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a hated burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.</p>
<p>This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="高考"><a href="#高考" class="headerlink" title="高考"></a>高考</h2><h3 id="我的经历"><a href="#我的经历" class="headerlink" title="我的经历"></a>我的经历</h3><p>春节这些天我在北京, 一直在看书一直在思考. 思考我一直以来对事情的理解和处理方法的不当的地方.<br>有些做得不对的地方从高中就开始了. 高考前的几次摸底考试在班上平时成绩7,8名, 可是高考放榜后发现排名大概18名, 离一本线差5分, 在我之前还有个一本线差1分的. 当时觉得不是特别好.<br>吴书豪也说过班上的同学考得比较糟. 他高考前三个月开始发力, 我不知道他是怎么发现班上同学考的比较糟糕的. 可对我来说, 都一样: 高考终于结束了.</p>
<p>最让我反感的就是高考的命题作文, 这种作文要写好, 最好写个议论性质的散文, 也就所谓的什么都没说, 但是私藏了一大堆私货的文章.<br>在这个过程中, 司马迁受了无数次宫刑. 我们作为祖国的花朵, 未来的刀笔吏, 无数次的阉割了太史公, 我很心痛.</p>
<p>散文行到实在无话可说之处, 可让太史公出来受刑:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>无法入睡的夜晚, 死囚的监狱分外寂静<br>司马迁在狱中看到皇帝的诏书, 他的手在止不住的颤抖, 士可杀不可辱! 司马迁心中一阵怒火, 死亡并没有让他恐惧, 而是静下心来思考人生的意义<br>人生自古谁无死, 留取丹心照汗青, 文天祥的话穿越时空回响在他的耳边, 死并不可怕, 可怕的是人生没有意义, 不能实现价值, 不能开宗立派传播学说<br>想起还没有修完的史记, 司马迁脸上露出了一副欣慰的表情, 是的, 一定要把史记写完, 实现”<em>与你为邻</em>(<em>绿色生活</em>, <em>找回童年</em>, <em>仰望星空, 脚踏实地</em>等作文题主题)<br>司马迁平静地对狱卒说, 我选择宫刑<br>寂静的夜晚, 只有孤独的月光投在他的脸上, “”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>司马迁已然欣然受刑之后仍然无话可说, 那就使用名人名言. 名人一般用苏格拉底, 亚里士多德, 文化好一点的可以用尼采, 司汤达, 陀思妥耶夫斯基, 剑走偏锋可以召唤毛姆, 安兰德, 维特根斯坦<br>当这些人的名人名言都用完了, 而你的散文还没有凑到字数, 那就只用用最后一招了: 请先贤<br>先贤以美国学者/教授或者古希腊哲/德国哲学家为甚.</p>
<p>比如美国著名学者肖玉秀.<br>开玩笑的</p>
<p>直接写我们英语老师肖玉秀的名讳我们的语文老师王薇老师要生气的<br>于是我们要变通, 比如肖对应sculpture, 玉对应jade, 秀对应show, 那么这位美国著名学者, 哈佛大学社会心理学博士的名字就叫做斯卡普彻尔 点 杰德, 于是show就可以留给下一个古希腊的哲学家用, 或者作为斯卡普彻尔教授的中间名凑字数.<br>当然这个时候要展现出灵活性, 这样的名人肯定不会因为说了一句”吃饭是人类的本性”而闻名的, 我们需要一些形而上的名言来作为前段的总结和开启后面的叨逼, 所以类似于”人类在宇宙中的位置” “人生的意义” “瞬间与永恒” “家庭, 爱与美”这样形而上的名言是最不错的</p>
<p>当然, 多年以后, 我想起来, 咪蒙老师写命题作文比我们顺手多了, 至少她只需要请我一朋友, 我一同学, 我邻居的大舅就行了, 用不着每次都费尽心力请古希腊哲学家肯德罗夫菠菠斯基<br>不过做迷蒙老师的朋友和同学或者她邻居家的二舅就很累了, 动不动老公就直男癌, 就家暴, 就出轨, 为了你们的幸福着想, 朋友们, 谨慎跟咪蒙老师这样的人打交道.</p>
<p>我不知道高考前三个月开始发力的吴书豪是怎么发现大家考得不好的<br>我永不放弃武力作为解决与其他男性的矛盾的最终途径的权利<br>, 当然, 看上去我们的教授是个标准的中年白人男性, 如果要突出美国的多元文化和种族的diversity, 只需要将jade翻译成 耶德</p>
<h3 id="高考的本质"><a href="#高考的本质" class="headerlink" title="高考的本质"></a>高考的本质</h3><p>当时不懂事, 只觉得自己是被时代的洪流裹挟着向前, 结束这场高考就行了, 现在想想简直是太稚嫩了.<br>一方面, 差一点上一本线(当年一本上线率4.60%), 在一帮获得985 211录取通知的同学中间显得很掉价; 另一方面其他的平时比我更用功, 更努力的同学考出来却只能准备复读, 我觉得有种黑色幽默的荒诞.<br>正如当时隐约看过的理论来说, 高考并不是让大家都上大学, 而是用来决定谁不能上大学, 以及上大学的人当中谁上更好的大学. 当时觉得高考是个很糟糕的制度, 现在看来并非如此.<br>考学和文官制度是正经的宝贵的东方文化遗产, 是一套注重机会平等社会层级流通方式. 在这个过程中, 衡量的手段客观而且容易量化, 因此是一个简单易行的社会分化器, 无数人的人生轨迹就被这个考试改变了.</p>
<p>高考十分注重方法论和总结, 能在这两点上做好的人, 做其他方面也不会差. 有个说法说就算现在高考改成打dota, 也还是那些原本上重点大学的人继续上重点大学. 这话不无道理.</p>
<h3 id="方法论"><a href="#方法论" class="headerlink" title="方法论"></a>方法论</h3><p>高考能够做好的人, 其他的东西也不会差<br>方法论的尝试提炼和升级是人的核心竞争力</p>
<h2 id="大学"><a href="#大学" class="headerlink" title="大学"></a>大学</h2><h3 id="本科上成了专科"><a href="#本科上成了专科" class="headerlink" title="本科上成了专科"></a>本科上成了专科</h3><p>然而即使是在大学里面, 我做得也并不好.<br>本科学习的本质大部分实际上是为了继续下一步深入的学习和研究做准备和铺垫, 而并非培养技术工人. 读本科正确的做法应该是学而优则学, 而我却花了太多的时间在一些 “七天学会PHP 21天学会C++” 以及焦虑上.<br>在本科的学习过程中, 我尝试去做了一些事情, 有成功也有失败, 但是总体来说还是做得很不到位的, 总结做得并不好. 在学习方法和自我管理方面基本没有主动去学习, 这也是造成后来我的第一份工作非常吃力的原因之一.</p>
